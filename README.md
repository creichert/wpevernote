## Support

- [Issue tracker][issues]


## Troubleshooting

- The evernote-cloud-sdk-php is required to run this plugin. It currently needs to be downloaded separately and put in the wpevernote/ directory. It will be bundled in the next release.

- v2.0 of this plugin and up only support the
evernote-cloud-sdk-php.  Refer to prior versions of wpevernote for
classic php SDK and PHP OAuth Extension support.

- Sandbox mode must be enabled manually in the wpevernote.php
function.
